# reddit-email-service

Hi, welcome to Techstarta Challenge

## Brief

In a world with unlimited content and choice, it becomes difficult to focus on the topics that really matter to us as an individual.

I personally use Reddit to create my own little personalized view of the world. My favorite topics are new technologies, politics, and funny memes!

I noticed that many of my friends are using Reddit too! We are all over the world, some of us in Berlin others in Denver, and some in Miami. Our interest of course also differs greatly.

Now, browsing Reddit is fun and all, but we want to spend as much time as possible on more important things! And you know how it is, once you are on Reddit, you just can't leave.

## Getting started

We had a hangout and put our heads together as a committee of friends, and after hours of brainstorming, packs of empty whiteboard markers, and two pizzas we found the solution! We would each like to receive a daily personalized newsletter at 8 am, containing the 3 most-voted posts from our (each user's) favorite subreddits!

## Your mission

Build a service that handles the following things:

- creating and updating users
- creating and updating a user's favorite subreddits
- setting the newsletter to send out time for each user (default: 8 am)
- turning on and off the newsletter sent out for a specific user
- triggering the send of a newsletter to each respective user's email at each user-specified send-out time.
